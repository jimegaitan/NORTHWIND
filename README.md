## :globe_with_meridians: About Northwind 
The Northwind database is a well-known sample dataset originally provided by Microsoft to demonstrate the functionalities of relational databases, particularly in SQL Server. It simulates a real-world business scenario, representing the operations of a fictional company that imports and sells specialty food products worldwide. The dataset is structured to include various business entities, such as customers, orders, employees, products, suppliers, and shipping details.

## ðŸ“Œ Why is it important?
Northwind is one of the most widely used sample databases for learning SQL and database management. It provides a practical environment for understanding:
- How relational databases are structured and how tables interact through primary and foreign keys.
- The implementation of SQL queries, from basic selection statements to complex joins, subqueries, and aggregations.
- Business logic, such as order processing, inventory management, and customer relationships.
- The integration of databases with applications using ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) in languages like Python, C#, and Java.
- Performance optimization techniques, including indexing, normalization, and transaction handling.

### Now, let's take a closer look at the structure of this database.
